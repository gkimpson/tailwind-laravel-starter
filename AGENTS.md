# Contributor Guide

This document codifies how to work in the `tailwind-laravel-starter` repository. Follow the guidance below whenever you touch files within this project tree.

## Project Snapshot

- **Stack**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+), Livewire Flux, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Flowbite UI, and standard Composer/NPM tooling.
- **Goal**: Provide a ready-to-extend starter that showcases Flowbite components wired up to a Laravel back end and modern asset pipeline.
- **Mindset**: Favor incremental, reviewable changes. Mirror the conventions already used in existing controllers, Blade templates, tests, and Tailwind styles.

## Repository Layout

- `app/`, `routes/`, `database/`: Laravel domain logic, HTTP routes, factories, migrations, and seeders.
- `resources/views/`, `resources/css/`, `resources/js/`: Blade templates, Tailwind entrypoints, Livewire components, and JavaScript helpers.
- `public/`: Compiled assets and the main Blade entrypoint served by Laravel.
- `config/`, `bootstrap/`, `storage/`, `tests/`: Vendor-level configuration, bootstrap cache, runtime artifacts, and PHPUnit test suites.
- Node- and PHP-specific configs live at the repo root (`composer.json`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`). When touching a file, glance at nearby config to stay consistent.

## Prerequisites

- PHP **8.2+** with required extensions, Composer **2.6+**, and Node.js **18+** with npm.
- Recommended: SQLite for quick local DBs, or MySQL/PostgreSQL if you need parity with production.
- Install `pnpm`/`yarn` only if you configure lockfiles accordingly; npm is the supported client in this repo.

## Initial Setup

1. `cp .env.example .env` and set database/mail credentials locally. Never commit filled `.env` files.
2. `composer install` to pull PHP dependencies. Composer scripts will auto-generate the app key, SQLite database, and publish assets.
3. `npm install` to sync Node dependencies required for Vite, Tailwind, and Flowbite.
4. Run `php artisan key:generate` if you change `.env` after the Composer hooks execute.
5. Create a database and run `php artisan migrate --seed` (or use the SQLite file under `database/`).

## Day-to-Day Development

- Use `composer run dev` for a full-stack workflow (Laravel server, queue listener, log tailing via Pail, and `npm run dev` for Vite). This is the easiest way to reproduce the expected environment.
- Alternatively, run the pieces independently: `php artisan serve`, `php artisan queue:listen --tries=1`, `npm run dev`, and `php artisan pail --timeout=0`.
- Keep `npm run build` tidy before release branches to ensure Vite outputs match the production configuration.
- Flush caches when modifying config or routes: `php artisan optimize:clear`.
- When working on background jobs or events, ensure the queue worker is running locally to catch failures early.

## Coding Standards

- **PHP/Laravel**: Follow PSR-12 formatting, leverage dependency injection, request validation classes, and route model binding. Keep controllers lean; move complex logic into services or actions within `app/`.
- **Blade & Livewire**: Prefer Blade components and partials (`resources/views/components/`) to duplicated markup. Use localized strings and escape output unless explicitly rendering HTML from trusted sources.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Write modern ES modules compiled via Vite. Keep DOM queries scoped, and avoid inline scripts in Blade unless absolutely necessary. Use Axios for HTTP calls to stay consistent with existing dependencies.
- **CSS/Tailwind**: Use Tailwind utility classes or custom classes defined in `resources/css/app.css`. When adding Flowbite components, import their directives once in the Tailwind entry file; do not duplicate `@plugin` or `@source` lines.
- **Static Analysis**: Run `./vendor/bin/pint` to fix PHP style issues before opening a PR.

## Assets and Build Output

- Tailwind v4 uses the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin; ensure additional plugins are registered in `vite.config.js` rather than inline within Blade.
- Place bespoke styles in `resources/css/` so they flow through Tailwind’s layering. Avoid editing generated CSS in `public/`.
- Store custom JS under `resources/js/` and reference it via Vite entrypoints declared in `vite.config.js`.
- When integrating Flowbite components, register their JS in `resources/js/app.js` and ensure required data attributes are present.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- Run `php artisan test` (PHPUnit) before submitting changes. Write new tests in `tests/Feature` or `tests/Unit` to cover new logic, seeders, and Livewire behaviors.
- For UI-heavy work, add Laravel Dusk/Pest coverage only if the repo already contains the tooling; otherwise describe manual steps in the PR.
- Exercise migrations with `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` whenever you alter schema files to confirm they stay idempotent.
- Use `npm run build` to ensure Vite production builds succeed, especially if you touch Tailwind config or import new packages.

## Git Workflow & Reviews

- Branch naming: `feature/<short-description>` for product work, `fix/<issue-id>` for patches, `chore/<task>` for tooling or docs.
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive; reference issue numbers in either the commit body or PR description.
- Do not re-write history on shared branches. Rebase locally before opening a PR to keep diffs clean.
- Draft PR template:
  - Summary of changes and rationale
  - Verification steps (tests run, screenshots, commands)
  - Notes on migrations, breaking changes, or follow-ups

## Documentation & Tracking

- Update `README.md`, code comments, or inline docblocks when behavior changes.
- For workflow-specific instructions, add scoped `AGENTS.md` files inside subdirectories so future contributors inherit the right rules.
- Log known limitations or TODOs in issues rather than inline comments unless the code genuinely needs immediate context.

## Security & Secrets

- Never commit `.env`, database dumps, or API keys. Rely on `.env.example` for placeholders.
- Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers before opening a public issue.
- Sanitize external input and escape Blade output by default. When rendering Flowbite components with user data, validate and encode content to mitigate XSS.

## Getting Help

- Prefer GitHub Discussions or issue comments for async questions so the answers remain searchable.
- When blocked, provide reproducible steps, log excerpts, and the commands you already ran. This shortens turnaround during reviews.

Thank you for contributing! Following these guidelines keeps the starter reliable and approachable for the next developer.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.3.27
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/flux (FLUXUI_FREE) - v2
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== herd rules ===

## Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate URLs for the user to ensure valid URLs.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(s). It is _always_ available through Laravel Herd.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] <name>` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== fluxui-free/core rules ===

## Flux UI Free

- This project is using the free edition of Flux UI. It has full access to the free components and variants, but does not have access to the Pro components.
- Flux UI is a component library for Livewire. Flux is a robust, hand-crafted, UI component library for your Livewire applications. It's built using Tailwind CSS and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.
- You should use Flux UI components when available.
- Fallback to standard Blade components if Flux is unavailable.
- If available, use Laravel Boost's `search-docs` tool to get the exact documentation and code snippets available for this project.
- Flux UI components look like this:

<code-snippet name="Flux UI Component Usage Example" lang="blade">
    <flux:button variant="primary"/>
</code-snippet>


### Available Components
This is correct as of Boost installation, but there may be additional components within the codebase.

<available-flux-components>
avatar, badge, brand, breadcrumbs, button, callout, checkbox, dropdown, field, heading, icon, input, modal, navbar, profile, radio, select, separator, switch, text, textarea, tooltip
</available-flux-components>


=== livewire/core rules ===

## Livewire Core
- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version specific documentation for how to write Livewire & Livewire tests.
- Use the `php artisan make:livewire [Posts\CreatePost]` artisan command to create new components
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend, they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data, and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()` for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle hook examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>


## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire component test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>


    <code-snippet name="Testing a Livewire component exists within a page" lang="php">
        $this->get('/posts/create')
        ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
    </code-snippet>


=== livewire/v3 rules ===

## Livewire 3

### Key Changes From Livewire 2
- These things changed in Livewire 2, but may not have been updated in this application. Verify this application's setup to ensure you conform with application conventions.
    - Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates, `wire:model` is now deferred by default.
    - Components now use the `App\Livewire` namespace (not `App\Http\Livewire`).
    - Use `$this->dispatch()` to dispatch events (not `emit` or `dispatchBrowserEvent`).
    - Use the `components.layouts.app` view as the typical layout path (not `layouts.app`).

### New Directives
- `wire:show`, `wire:transition`, `wire:cloak`, `wire:offline`, `wire:target` are available for use. Use the documentation to find usage examples.

### Alpine
- Alpine is now included with Livewire, don't manually include Alpine.js.
- Plugins included with Alpine: persist, intersect, collapse, and focus.

### Lifecycle Hooks
- You can listen for `livewire:init` to hook into Livewire initialization, and `fail.status === 419` for the page expiring:

<code-snippet name="livewire:load example" lang="js">
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', function () {
    Livewire.hook('request', ({ fail }) => {
        if (fail && fail.status === 419) {
            alert('Your session expired');
        }
    });

    Livewire.hook('message.failed', (message, component) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
});
</code-snippet>


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== phpunit/core rules ===

## PHPUnit Core

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit <name>` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files, these are core to the application.

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.
<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.
</laravel-boost-guidelines>
