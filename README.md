# Laravel 12 and Tailwind CSS Starter

[Check out this guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/laravel/) to learn how to set up a new Laravel project together with Tailwind CSS and the UI components from Flowbite to enhance your front-end development workflow.

## Create a Laravel app

Make sure that you have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" rel="nofollow">Composer</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> installed locally on your computer.

Follow the next steps to install Tailwind CSS and Flowbite with Laravel Mix. 

1. Require the Laravel Installer globally using Composer:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Make sure to place the vendor bin directory in your PATH. Here's how you can do it based on each OS:

- macOS: `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"`
- Windows: `set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- Linux: `export PATH="~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"`

2. Create a new project using Laravel's CLI:

```bash
laravel new flowbite-app
cd flowbite-app
```

Start the development server using the following command:

```bash
composer run dev
```

You can now access the Laravel application on `http://localhost:8000`.

This command will initialize a blank Laravel project that you can get started with.

## Install Tailwind CSS

Since Laravel 12, the latest version of Tailwind v4 will be installed by default, so if you have that version or later then you can skip this step and proceed with installing Flowbite.

1. Install Tailwind CSS using NPM:

```javascript
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite --save-dev
```

2. Configure the `vite.config.ts` file by importing the Tailwind plugin:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
    // â€¦
  ],
})
```

3. Import the main Tailwind directive inside your `app.css` CSS file:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

5. Run the build process for Vite using `npm run dev`. Use `npm run build` for production builds.

## Install Flowbite

[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) is a popular and open-source UI component library built on top of the Tailwind CSS framework that allows you to choose from a wide range of UI components such as modals, drawers, buttons, dropdowns, datepickers, and more to make your development workflow faster and more efficient.

Follow the next steps to install Flowbite using NPM.

1. Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

```bash
npm install flowbite --save
```

2. Import the default theme variables from Flowbite inside your main `input.css` CSS file:

```css
@import "flowbite/src/themes/default";
```

3. Import the Flowbite plugin file in your CSS:

```css
@plugin "flowbite/plugin";
```

4. Configure the source files of Flowbite in your CSS:

```css
@source "../../node_modules/flowbite";
```

5. Add the Flowbite JS script inside your main `app.blade.php` layout file:

```html
<body>
    @yield('content')

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@3.1.2/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

This will have the JavaScript loaded in all the files that extend this main layout.

## UI components

Now that you have successfully installed the project you can start using the [UI components from Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/laravel/) and Tailwind CSS to develop modern websites and web applications.

We recommend exploring the components using the search bar navigation (`cmd` or `ctrl` + `k`) or by browsing the components section of the sidebar on the left side of this page.

If this has installed correctly you should now see many more components -> as shown below
